# IR Line Following Car
The IR Line Following Car is a RC car retrofitted with two IR sensors to detect and follow a line. The car is also implemented with various modes such as a regular remote control mode and an obstacle avoidance mode. 

6/15/2024: With the BlueStamp portfolios being on GitHub pages now (which are easier to edit compared to the previous use of WordPress), I remade my portfolio on here. Original can be found here [here](https://projects.bluestampengineering.com/student-projects/terry-w/). Some minor tweaks/additions were made but most of it has been copied and pasted. Some formatting inconsistencies exist because the content back in 2019 was different from now.

For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```python
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Starter Project: Temperature Sensor Display
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wkpTRRvu_wk?si=yXcstMhYHB4B3w3G" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

My starter project is the Temperature Sensor Display. The temperature sensor display features an LCD which displays the temperature. I chose the project because I wanted to challenge myself (it was rated as one of the harder projects), found it the most interesting, and thought it would be a good balance between light coding and soldering.

The entire project consists of the following components: an Arduino Uno, a mini breadboard, jumper wires, a potentiometer, a temperature sensor, and a LCD (liquid crystal display). The core component of the entire project is the temperature sensor. The sensor works by changing its voltage output, proportionally to the change in temperature.  The Arduino then reads the analog signal, and through a series of equations, converts it into a digital signal, and displays it on the LCD.
